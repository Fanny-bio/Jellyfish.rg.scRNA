This fold contains data for cross-species comparisons of cell types. 

For Direct Comparison:
Preprocessed matrices from Levy et al. 2021 were used, including single-cell RNA data from:
       -Nematostella vectensis (Nvec) (Sebe-Pedros at al. Cell 2018); 
       -Hydra vulgaris (Hvul) (Siebert et al. Science 2019);
       -Xenia sp. (Xesp) (Hu et al. Nature 2020);
       -Stylophora pistillata (Xesp) (Levy et al. Cell 2021.).
We created the expression matrices of Clytia hemisphaerica using data from Chari et al. 2021.
